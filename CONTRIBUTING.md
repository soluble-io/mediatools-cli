# CONTRIBUTING

## Recommended workflow

### Step 1: Make your own fork.

1. Setup a [GitHub account](https://github.com/), if you haven't yet.
2. Fork the project (i.e from the github project page). 
3. Clone your newly created fork: 

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/<username>/soluble-mediatools-cli.git`
```

4. Install deps

```shell
$ composer update
```

### Step 2: Change code  

1. Create a new branch from master (i.e. feature/24)
2. Modify the code... Fix, improve :)

### Step 3: Release a P/R (pull request)

If you have disabled .githooks:

1. First ensure the code is clean

```shell
$ composer fix
$ composer check
```
2. Commit/Push your pull request.
